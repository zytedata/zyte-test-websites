        " to boost production from an expected 180,000 tonnes this year to"
        " 600,000 tonnes by 2008. The government will pump 154m naira ($1.1m;"
        " Â£591,000) into subsidies for farming chemicals and seedlings."
        " Nigeria is currently the world's fourth-largest cocoa producer."
        "  Cocoa was the main export product in Nigeria during the 1960s. But"
        " with the coming of oil, the government began to pay less attention"
        " to the cocoa sector and production began to fall from a peak of"
        " about 400,000 tonnes a year in 1970. At the launch of the programme"
        " in the south-western city of Ibadan, Mr Bello explained that an"
        " additional aim of the project is to encourage the processing of"
        " cocoa in the country and lift local consumption. He also announced"
        " that 91m naira of the funding available had been earmarked for"
        " establishing cocoa plant nurseries. The country could be looking to"
        " emulate rival Ghana, which produced a bumper crop last year."
        ' However, some farmers are sceptical about the proposals. "People'
        ' who are not farming will hijack the subsidy," said Joshua Osagie,'
        ' a cocoa farmer from Edo state told Reuters. "The farmers in the'
        ' village never see any assistance," he added.  At the same time as'
        " Nigeria announced its new initiative, Ghana - the world's second"
        " largest cocoa exporter - announced revenues from the industry had"
        " broken new records. The country saw more than $1.2bn-worth of the"
        " beans exported during 2003-04. Analysts said high tech-production"
        " techniques and crop spraying introduced by the government led to"
        " the huge crop, pushing production closer to levels seen in the 1960s"
        " when the country was the world's leading cocoa grower."
